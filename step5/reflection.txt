# Final Reflection

Overall, I think the project was a nice idea and I learned how to use the individual services. However, some
aspects made this project really hard for me and made me spend a lot of time on minor issues instead of
focussing on learning about the actual tools.

## Azure Availabilty

I started the project on my private Azure account. At some point I realized that using the Face API is forbidden
for private accounts and there is also no option to request it for the course. Therefore, I switched to the
Udacity lab that only gave me 7 hours of time for each iteration. This is certainly not enough to finish this project
in one run.

As a consequence, I had to setup resources several times which took a lot of time. I created some Terraform code to
make this preparation step a bit quicker but this automation was only possible for a part of the project. This was
quite unfortunate as this was a task requiring great dilligence and I would have liked to spend that time on making
the project better.

## Documentation

It's not surprising that the Azure AI Services are updated very frequently. Unfortunately, this created some issues
when documentation was not updated, information was missing or links in the documentation were not working. Overall,
figuring out small details also took me some time I would have liked to spend on making this project stand out.

For example, I missed setting CORS in the Azure Storage before connecting it to the Custom Vidion UI. The error message
was vague, so I tried several approaches (adding specific roles) until I figured out what was missing. Even then, the UI
was not working until I realized I had to go back to the project setup, select the Blob storage again and save it.
